## Description

word_counter.py provides a module that enables users to count the words in their documents and display a histogram showing the occurrence of each word.

Currently, word_counter supports .txt and .html. PDF support is in development since their are some dependency issues.

## Using word_counter

The module provides a frontend function called word_counter(). This function takes two arguments: the file path as a string, and a boolean option to display the histogram.

The function is word_counter(file, display_histogram=False). The first argument is required and the second is optional. By default, the function does not display the histogram.
To display the histogram, a user must provide True as the second argument.

In your code do the following:

from word_counter import word_counter

Then you can utilize word_counter() anywhere in your application.
